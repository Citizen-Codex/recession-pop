    2009 is back.

    Or so the internet says.

    More than a decade later, it seems like the formula still holds true: the winds of recession are being foretold by dance songs. Eggs are $5 a dozen, there’s a major hiring freeze, and music has cycled back to the familiar beats of recession pop.
    

    As Lady Gaga herself puts it in her newest song: “Dance…or die.”

  hed: Music and the Economy

    This dichotomy between pop music and the state of the economy isn’t new. When the Great Depression cut short the Roaring Twenties and laid waste to the American economy, <a href="https://www.cooperhewitt.org/2017/06/24/the-solitude-of-swing/">big band swing</a> brought people out of their houses and onto the dance floor. When the 1970s recession put an end to the post-WWII economic boom, disco <a href="https://liveforlivemusic.com/features/disco-saturday-night-fever/">caught on like a fever</a>. In 2009, two months after the Great Recession wrecked the American economy, Kesha rallied the masses with her iconic line: "<i>Now, the party don't start 'til I walk in.</i>"


    On their own, jazz and disco and electro-pop don’t seem to have much in common. Yet each swung high during periods of social and economic upheaval, offering an escape from the tough times through loud, feel-good music.


    <b>To examine their commonalities, we looked at 50 years of Billboard's Year-End Hot 100 songs.</b>

        Taking inspiration from the OG era of recession pop, we filtered for songs with BPMs of 120 or higher, as well as danceability and energy scores at and above the 60th percentile.


        These scores represent Spotify-based measures calculated through an algorithmic assessment of tempo, rhythm, dynamic range, and loudness.
    - content: Here are the songs that kept spirits high and bodies moving on the dance floor. 
    - content: But is the science behind the recession part of recession pop actually true? 
    - content: Recent studies say yes. When tracked against negative macroeconomic indicators like high unemployment, inflation, and interest rates, or major shocks like the COVID pandemic, researchers found that people tend to listen to <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-024-00757-4">happier music</a> with more <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9358113/#Sec19">positive lyrics</a> to alleviate unhappiness, anxiety, and stress.
    - content: As people find their material consumption habits involuntarily altered by recessions, it follows that their cultural consumption and media attitudes would shift as well. 
    - content: Here’s what that relationship looks like charted.
    - content: As shown, major recessions—marked by dips in the real GDP line—tend to coincide with spikes in recession pop music.
    - content: Looking at unemployment data reveals similar patterns. Across the decades, recession pop revivals have generally aligned with inflections in the yearly unemployment rate, supporting the theory that economic cycles are in some way linked to music consumption.
    - content: So, what comes next? Once the economy has bounced back, you’d assume that the demand for dancey, end-of-the-world, escapist music would fade. Right?
    - content: >
        <b>Nope.</b>


        Notice that the popularity of this genre often peaked after the recessions themselves were declared over.
    - content: When times are tough, people seek high-energy dance music to help them forget about their troubles. In reverse, we’d expect that demand to fade once the economy improves, but that’s not the case here. The recession pop theory falls short.

        Enter 'Vibecession'"

    Simply put: <b>the bad vibes linger</b>. 


    The trauma of a recession creates what Kyla Scanlon, economic influencer and author of In This Economy, calls a <a href="https://kyla.substack.com/p/the-vibecession-the-self-fulfilling">Vibecession</a>. “Where economically speaking,” she says, “things are okay-ish but in reality… the vibes are off. People are feeling bad.”

    Recession pop appeals to the masses by offering people an escape from their fear and anxiety, even for a brief moment. As vestiges of a recession linger—job insecurity, rising living costs, political instability—people continue to seek relief from fantasies of an unburdened life.  


    We see this reflected in pop music cycles even decades back.

      The early 70s were tense. Massive social and political shifts swept the nation as it grappled with the aftermath of the Stonewall riots, the ongoing Vietnam War, and the fight for civil rights, all while an oil crisis sparked an economic decline.


      Out of these turbulent years came the disco scene, where Black, Latino, and gay communities could find liberation, self-expression, and freedom through exuberant fashion and music on the dance floor. Disco left the underground clubs of New York and Philadelphia and hit mainstream popularity after the release of the dance film Saturday Night Fever, achieving global commercial success in the late 70s.

      Recession returned in the early 80s as tightening monetary policies caused unemployment to jump to 10% by 1982. At the same time, the music industry adopted digital and electronic technologies such as synthesizers, drum machines, and computer-based productions, giving rise to electronic dance music (EDM) and influencing genres like new wave, R&B, and rock.


      The 1980s also ushered in a revolutionizing force in the American entertainment industry: MTV. The channel popularized music videos as a key promotional tool for shaping an artist's image and connecting with audiences. This strategy propelled artists like Madonna, Prince, and Michael Jackson into superstardom as visual storytelling and dance choreography became integral to their music.

      Unlike previous decades, the 90s economy boomed. Following a brief and mild recession in the early years, the U.S. entered a period of sustained economic expansion marked by robust job growth, rapid technological advancement, and rising productivity.

      Electronic music continued to evolve, drawing inspiration from Europe’s techno, rave, and drum & bass scene. But the radios were dominated by a diverse mix of other genres: alternative rock bands like Nirvana, R&B soloists like Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston, boy bands and girl groups, and pioneers of the golden age of hip hop.
      
      Perhaps the popularity of these other genres, combined with the absence of a major recession, kept the escapist recession pop songs of previous decades off the Billboard charts. It wouldn’t be long, though, before they came back with a vengeance.

      The next two decades were marked by two significant recessions: the dot-com crash of 2001, soon overshadowed by the Great Recession of 2007–2009, which toppled major banks and triggered millions of home foreclosures.
    
      These were the true recession pop years. Think Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Kesha, The Black Eyed Peas, Rihanna, Pitbull. Think blissed-out club hits about living it up and going out tonight. If you can’t make rent tomorrow anyway, might as well spend your last $10 on drinks!
      
      While the recession was declared contained by June 2009, this genre didn’t peak until 2011-2012, making up 25% of the top 100 Billboard songs for the year. Even as the economy slowly began to recover, it was clear that the public needed this outlet, if only as a coping mechanism to weather the brutal aftershocks that lingered in their lives.

      Music of the early 2020s was indelibly marked by the COVID-19 lockdowns. When Taylor Swift dropped folklore and evermore as surprise gifts for everyone stuck at home, the escapism she offered was more stripped-down. It was colored by romanticism, grief, and nostalgia compared to the frenetic energy of past recession pop.

      Now, with clubs fully reopened and festivals back in full swing, music has returned to the sonic cheer of the late aughts, despite not having a recession to accompany it. Beyonce’s Renaissance paid homage to Black dance music through an eclectic blend of disco, house, and ballroom. Chappell Roan’s meteoric rise to fame last year brought back slumber party pop and fun “Y.M.C.A.”-esque crowd choreography.   
       
      Moreover, if you haven’t heard of Charli XCX’s Brat, were you even around last summer? Though its songs did not make it to the Billboard year-end charts (perhaps because the album begs for a full listen in its entirety), its wild, frenzied soundscape evokes the party anthems of the Great Recession, despite being released during a relatively good year for the economy.

    Pop music has always been a lens through which people could respond to social and political turbulence. The democratization of self-made music production and the rise in algorithmic virality has only made the pop music landscape <a href="https://www.hotknifemag.com/read-1/towards-a-theory-of-recession-pop">more sensitive</a> to consumer sensibilities, turning it into a real-time cultural barometer.


    The vibecession theory thus provides a framework for understanding this dissonance between the state of the world and the type of music that emotionally resonates with us. Recession pop signals a collective anxiety over the stress of structural forces that continue to leech into our lives. When the vibes are down, we cling to these material fantasies of luxury, excess, and indulgence. They provide an illusion of economic agency in a world that increasingly denies it—even as the economy grows wealthier than ever.


  quote: >
      I knew my rent was gon' be late

      about a week ago

      I worked my ass off, 

      but I still can't pay it, though

      But I got just enough 

      to get off in this club

      Have me a good time, 
      
      before my time is up

    The economic truth is one thing, but our perception of it is another. The fabric of our lived reality—what we read on the internet, hear on the news, or talk to other people about—plays a greater role in shaping our perspective on the world than objective indicators like GDP growth or inflation rates. So it makes sense that we continue to crave these escapist party anthems even when a recession is over. When groceries are expensive and saving for retirement feels like a pipe dream, who says we’re <b><i>not</b></i> still in one?
