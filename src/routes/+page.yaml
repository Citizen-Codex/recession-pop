    2009 is back.

    Or so the internet says.

    More than a decade later, it seems like the formula still holds true: the winds of recession are still being foretold by dance songs. Eggs are $5 a dozen, there’s a major hiring freeze, and music has cycled back to the familiar beats of recession pop.
    
    
    As Lady Gaga herself puts it in her newest song: “Dance…or die.”

    This dichotomy between pop music and the state of the economy isn’t a new phenomenon. When the Great Depression cut short the grand flourish of the Roaring Twenties and laid waste to the American economy for a decade, big band swing brought people out of their houses and onto the dance floor. When the 1970s recession put an end to the post-WWII economic boom, disco caught on like a fever. Two months after the Great Recession wrecked the American economy in 2009, Kesha rallied the masses with her iconic line: “Now, the party don't start 'til I walk in.”
    
    
    On their own, jazz and disco and electropop don’t seem to have much in common. Yet each swung high during periods of social and economic upheaval, offering an escape from the tough times through loud, feel-good music.

    Kyla Scanlon, author of In This Economy, sums this up as so: “The overwhelming nature of it all creates a Vibecession. Where economically speaking, things are okay-ish but in reality… the vibes are off. People are feeling bad.”


    Recession pop appeals to the masses by offering people an escape from their fear and anxiety, even for a brief moment. As vestiges of a recession linger—job insecurity, rising living costs, political instability—people continue to seek relief from fantasies of an unburdened life. 
    
    
    We see this reflected in pop music cycles even decades back.
